# Weapons

In-order to increase combat diversity and to try and altar the 1.19.3 (at the time of writing this page) combat META, there are a series of new items that can be added as a means of replacing the effectiveness of already implemented items such as axes.   

These new changes will also attempt to boost the usefulness and effectiveness of cavalary by making them more important and giving players more options in the range of weaponry they can choose from based on the situation.
