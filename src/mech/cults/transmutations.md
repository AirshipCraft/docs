# Transmutations
Transmutations are another aspect of `Cults` that has been planned (as of 02/10/2023) to add more depth to the system as well as incentivizing participation in the system.   

The way transmutations work is by allowing the `Cult` to be upgraded based on factors such as prayer count and `Believer` count. This rewards both active cults and large cults and keeping them as independent factors.   

Transmutations can be unlocked by only the `Head Priest` and can only be changed or modified after another succesfful upgrade. Transmutations serve as ways to enhance the player themselves through adding small modifiers to aspects such as but not limited to: 
- Jumpheight
- Movement speed
- Mining speed
- Nightvision
- Strength
    
This upgrade system is similar to the vanilla Minecraft's beacon system where modifiers can be selected based on beacon "level". The same concept is applied here for cults except that the modifiers can only be changed upon successfully levelling the cult.

Instead of having players choose what race they want to pick, the “traditional” race system (dwarves, elves, etc) would be replaced with a "transmutation" (alternatively called a transfiguration, the terms can be used interchangeably in this context) mechanic that ties into the cults system. Players can therefore change their “race” by praying to different deities in-order to achieve non-human abilities (think: werewolf, vampire type “races”)

An explanation of how this mechanic could work is outlined below:

- By changing the subject of worship (deity), players are granted traits that will give them increased player attributes 
- Traits can be defined by the worshipers / Head priest: 
  - It could be spells (giving player a set of spells to cast depending on who their worship)
  - Or enhancing player’s capability: faster walk speed, higher jump height, melee damage increase, range damage increase, health increase, regen increase
  - **Special traits**: free frost walker, slows entities that you hit, free fire aspect, fire immunity, regen on hitting an entity, explode on death, see players through walls, natural armor, claws, no fall damage, short teleport
- Traits will come at a cost and the worshipers / Head priest will have to pick the drawbacks 
  - **Regular drawbacks**: slower walk speed, lower jump height, melee damage decrease, range damage decrease, health decrease, regen decrease
  - **Critical drawbacks**: burning in sunlight, golden sword, holy symbol, carnivore, can only drink blood, weak to fire, aquaphobia, unable to cast magic, intensified/constant hunger, posion weakness, can only eat metal, unable to wear armor, unable to use weapons, unable to move if being stared at, Frigophobia (take damage when snowing or standing on ice/snow)
