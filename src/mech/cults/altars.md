# Altars

## Overview
Altars are the core of a `Cult` as they are the only way to create a cult and only way to perform certain rituals such as `Sacrifices`. Altars are meant to be kept safe since destruction of the `Altar` triggers a configurable timer that will dissolve the `Cult` if the `Altar` is not rebuilt in time.    

An altar is defined as a multi-block structure with three (3) main components:   
1. The altar block - The central piece to the altar
2. The altar sign - The sign attached to the altar. Has ``[Altar]`` on the first line. Right clicking it creates the altar and allows the player to pray to the altar.
3. Candles - Light up as a status indicator to show that the altar is properly registered.

Here is an example of an altar:
