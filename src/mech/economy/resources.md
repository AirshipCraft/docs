# Resources
One of the main components of the project is augmenting resource distribution in-order to promote trade as well as warfare. A good system of handling resource distribution and collection goes hand-in-hand with a good [economy](../economy.md) and [claiming system](../nation-system.md).

## Overview
By creating scarcity in Minecraft we pave the way for things such as civilizations, politics, and nation building.    

Scarcity can be controlled in three ways:

- Ore distribution
- Crop growth rate and distribution
- Animal breeding and spawn rates

Manipulating crop growth and animal spawnrates affect the player directly as they create a food scarcity which will push them furthor to trade and/or travel to new areas.
