# ACCommonLib
Shared common library framework for future plugins that are relevant to the project.

## Overview 
The purpose of this library is to attempt to eliminate as much unnecessary boilerplate code as possible. This includes things like implementing debugging features, a standardized command manager, and commented-configuration files.    

It also provides the basis for an NPC API as well as a library for particle-related code, including but not limited to vector and character tracking.
