# Housekeeping Rules
This page goes over some basic housekeeping rules in-order to maintain efficiency and organization within the project as well as instating some general guidelines about maintaining, contributing to, and using the project.

## Merge Conflicts and Prevention
> Version control systems, like git, auto-magically manage code contributions. It identifies the change, when it occurred, who made it, and on what line so that developers can easily track the history of their codebase. However, git sometimes gets confused in the following situations:
> 
> - When more than one person changes the same line in a file and tries to merge the change to the same branch
> - When a developer deletes a file, but another developer edits it, and they both try to merge their changes to the same branch.
> - When a developer deletes a line, but another developer edits it, and they both try to merge their changes to the same branch
> - When a developer is cherry-picking a commit, which is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another
> - When a developer is rebasing a branch, which is the process of moving a sequence of commits to a base commit

This can be extremely frustrating especially on a project such as this when there will be times where more than one person may be working on a specific piece of code.
