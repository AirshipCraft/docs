All information provided in this document is aimed at giving the new members of the development team as well as some existing old members some insight on what the AC:R project hopes to achieve. I will attempt to describe every single aspect of the server from it's history, it‚Äôs community, the type of players we want and attract, it‚Äôs issues over the years of past versions and attempts, it‚Äôs plans on how to fix those issues, planned features, mechanics, and gameplay, and finally it‚Äôs plans for the future in the greatest amount of detail possible. 

This is a living document. All content regarding mechanics and gameplay is subject to change as time goes on and development progresses. New things will constantly be added as they are developed.   

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see a list of features addded/removed and/or updated.  

This project utilizes [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning structure. The correct project version number should be displayed at the top of this page and the top of the changelog.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** at thie time of writing, this document is currently in major version 0 meaning there is no playable or stable version and the project is still in initial development.
