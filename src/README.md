All information provided in this document is aimed at giving the new members of the development team as well as some existing old members some insight on what the AC:R project hopes to achieve. I will attempt to describe every single aspect of the server from it's history, it‚Äôs community, the type of players we want and attract, it‚Äôs issues over the years of past versions and attempts, it‚Äôs plans on how to fix those issues, planned features, mechanics, and gameplay, and finally it‚Äôs plans for the future in the greatest amount of detail possible. 

This is a living document. All content regarding mechanics and gameplay is subject to change as time goes on and development progresses. New things will constantly be added as they are developed.

## A Brief History

## Project Overview
> This will serve as an overview of the entire project. More specific topics will be summarized after the outline and more in-depth explanations and plans for mechanics/features will recieve their own section. You can view all of these sections from the table of contents on the left of this page.

### A Quick Outline

The purpose of this project is to fulfill the vision of creating a "true" geopolitical experience in Minecraft. Although it is not based on an Earth map, the map is Earth-like enough to encourage the natural growth and creation of nation states through either player or NPC manipulation. "Dynamic" is the key buzzword for this project.   

The world, much like real-life, should feel fluid and constantly changing. Changing market prices due to inflation and supply and demand patterns, wars and diplomatic actions by foreign nations, natural disasters that effect multiple aspects of life, etc. All of these are examples of things that this project attempts to replicate in the virtual world. One more 

A primary focus of this project is the concentration on NPCs and heavily involving them in game mechanics. This is to keep gameplay constantly interesting as they (theoretically) serve many advantages to our goal.  

With NPC controlled nation states scattered across the map, there will constnatly be something for the player to do. In theory the server should be fun and playable even if the player is completely alone on the server.   

The goal of the economy is to be player-driven. There should be enough incentive for players acquiring currency without it being too much of an obstacle and therefore potential deterrant for new players. Finding a good balance is difficult but not impossible.
